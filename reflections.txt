# My reflections on "Mockup to Article" project

1- What new skills have I learned?
    * Use <s> <sup> tag to create visual effect on the text

2 - What has been easy?
    * So far, everything is easy, I only use pure HTML to re-create an Article.

3 - What has been difficult?
    * So far, nothing is difficult, but if CSS is involved, it would be a litlle more tricky.

4 - How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?
    * Search google, MDN for possible tags to make the exact visual effect in the article.
    * When I made any small change in the HTML, I refresh page to see if the small change is what I want according to the mockup and then I proceed.
